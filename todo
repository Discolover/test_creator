[ ] matching question

FIX:
[ ] adjacent itemslist have weird positioning when selecting one option for edit
[ ] new option textarea and pseuo new option has inconsistent resize behaviour. When user is entering a new option he wants it to be a specific height but we it doesn't stay with the element after we have added it to list 

backlog:
[ ] !consider using map instead of arrays to store questions and options which makes sense if I use order field any way. Need to try first
[ ] users unique identification using passwords
[ ] logout for admin
[ ] set time for test complition
[ ] grade tests
[ ] schedule tests
[ ] automatically resize textbox with more new text


consider:
[ ] is it possible to break my app from client if for example client decides to change IDs of my elements?
